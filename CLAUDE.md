# Project Guidelines

## Development Workflow

- Always create a feature branch before starting work (never commit directly to main)
- Use `gh issue create` or GitHub Web UI for tracking improvements and issues
  - Set appropriate labels (`priority:*`, `type:*`, `enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
  - Set appropriate milestone (`0.x.0` or `Backlog`)

## Code Quality

- For complex or high-difficulty tasks, warn the user and ask for confirmation
  - Consider the risk/reward balance
  - Avoid features that are difficult to implement but provide little value
